Write a function that takes an object parameter and prints out the content of the object nicely.
Each line of output, from console.log, should show each key and its associated value.

let menu_obj = {
  soup: "Soup du Jour",
  coffe: "Cuban"
};

menu_obj = 'Today's Specials';
menu["planet of origin"] = "are made today";
menu = "numbers are fine to use as keys as well!";

console.log(
  menu.soup + ", the " + "soup du jour" +
  " and " + menu.coffee["Columbian"] + ", are " + menu.specials
);

let my_obj = { name: "Patrick", location: "Virginia" };

pretty_print(my_obj);
